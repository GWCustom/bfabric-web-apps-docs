## Use Case Overview

The following chapters present proof-of-concept examples demonstrating how the `bfabric_web_apps` library can be used to build real-life applications. Each use case illustrates how the modular architecture and reusable components of the library support the rapid development of web-based tools that integrate with the B-Fabric ecosystem.

**Work in Progress**  
The following use case chapters are currently under construction and not yet complete. Content will be added and refined continuously to better showcase applications built with the `bfabric_web_apps` library.
```

* **[RNA-seq](rna_seq_use_case.md)** – Demonstrates how to run a large-scale pipeline like RNA-seq via a fully integrated Dash interface using bfabric_web_apps.
* **[Demultiplex](demultiplex_use_case.md)** – A web application designed to run the nf-core pipeline for BCL to FASTQ demultiplexing, providing a streamlined interface for initiating and monitoring demultiplexing jobs.
* **[SUSHI Apps](sushi_use_case.md)** – Showcases an application wrapper for Sushi applications via B-Fabric that enables flexible job configuration and execution through the Sushi backend.

These examples highlight the library’s capabilities in both frontend user interaction and backend data management, serving as prototypes for future applications.
