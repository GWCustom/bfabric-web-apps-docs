# Introduction

**bfabric_web_apps** is a Python library designed for developing and integrating satellite applications with the **B-Fabric Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)**.

---

## Overview

Built to work seamlessly with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), **bfabric_web_apps** simplifies the development of web applications that interact with B-Fabric. Using a **template-based approach**, it standardizes common patterns, streamlines development, and provides a modular foundation for extending B-Fabric with satellite applications.

### Key Features

- **Seamless B-Fabric Integration**  
  - **Token Management** – Securely handle authentication tokens for API access.  
  - **Entity Data Handling** – Retrieve, modify, and update B-Fabric entities dynamically.  
  - **Integrated Logging** – Track API calls, application events, and errors for debugging and auditing.  

- **Custom Dashboards**  
  - Build **interactive, data-driven dashboards** with Dash and Plotly.  

- **Prebuilt UI Components & Layouts**  
  - Utilize **predefined Dash components, layouts, and callbacks** to accelerate development, maintain consistency, and enhance user experience.

## Get Started Quickly

Developers can hit the ground running with the **[bfabric_web_app_template](https://github.com/GWCustom/bfabric-web-app-template)**, a **ready-made** project that demonstrates how to configure and deploy a `bfabric_web_apps` application end-to-end. It includes:

- **Preconfigured layout** using Dash and Bootstrap.  
- **Authentication flow** for B-Fabric.  
- **Examples** of logging, API interaction, and entity handling.

By combining the **template** with the **bfabric_web_apps** library, you’ll have a **flexible**, **scalable** starting point for **building custom web apps** that tap into B-Fabric’s powerful capabilities.

## What Is BfabricPy?

**BfabricPy** is a Python library that serves as a programmatic interface to interact with the B-Fabric API. It enables developers to perform operations such as querying data, uploading results, and managing B-Fabric entities seamlessly from Python-based applications.

BfabricPy is a core dependency of **bfabric_web_apps** and powers API connections for building custom applications.

For more information, visit the [BfabricPy GitHub repository](https://github.com/fgcz/bfabricPy/tree/main).
