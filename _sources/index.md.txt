# Introduction

**bfabric_web_apps** is a Python library designed for developing and integrating satellite applications with the **B-Fabric Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)**.

---

## Overview

Built to work seamlessly with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), **bfabric_web_apps** simplifies the development of web applications that interact with B-Fabric. Using a **template-based approach**, it standardizes common patterns, streamlines development, and provides a modular foundation for extending B-Fabric with satellite applications.

### Key Features

- **Seamless B-Fabric Integration**  
  - **Token Management** – Securely handle authentication tokens for API access.  
  - **Entity Data Handling** – Retrieve, modify, and update B-Fabric entities dynamically.  
  - **Integrated Logging** – Track API calls, application events, and errors for debugging and auditing.  

- **Prebuilt UI Components & Layouts**  
  - Utilize **predefined Dash components, layouts, and callbacks** to accelerate development, maintain consistency, and enhance user experience.

## What Is This Library?

**bfabric_web_apps** is your **foundation** for building web applications that **interface directly** with B-Fabric. Its core objectives include:

- **Automating repetitive tasks** like token handling and entity lookups.  
- **Simplifying** the creation of dashboards with **Dash** and **Plotly** for data visualization.

## Quickstart 

Developers can hit the ground running with the **[bfabric_web_app_template](https://github.com/GWCustom/bfabric-web-app-template)**, a **ready-made** project that demonstrates how to configure and deploy a `bfabric_web_apps` application end-to-end. It includes:

- **Preconfigured layout** using Dash and Bootstrap.  
- **Authentication flow** for B-Fabric.  
- **Examples** of logging, API interaction, and entity handling.

By combining the **template** with the **bfabric_web_apps** library, you’ll have a **flexible**, **scalable** starting point for **building custom web apps** that tap into B-Fabric’s powerful capabilities.

## What Is B-Fabric?

B-Fabric is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) developed for managing scientific experiments and their associated data. It offers a robust platform to track samples, analyze results, and organize workflows efficiently for researchers, laboratories, and core facilities.

For more information, visit the [B-Fabric official website](https://fgcz-bfabric.uzh.ch/bfabric/).

## What Is BfabricPy?

**BfabricPy** is a Python library that serves as a programmatic interface to interact with the B-Fabric API. It enables developers to perform operations such as querying data, uploading results, and managing B-Fabric entities seamlessly from Python-based applications.

BfabricPy is a core dependency of **bfabric_web_apps** and powers API connections for building custom applications.

For more information, visit the [BfabricPy GitHub repository](https://github.com/fgcz/bfabricPy/tree/main).

## What Is Dash?

Dash is a Python framework for building interactive web applications with a focus on data visualization and analytics. It combines the power of Plotly for frontend visualizations and Flask for backend support, making it ideal for creating scientific and analytical dashboards.

For more details, refer to the [Dash official documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/).
